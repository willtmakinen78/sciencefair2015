# Science Fair 2015
Listed in this repository are some of the files used for the development of the Assistive Rehabilitarion Device (ARD), my highschool Freshman year science fair project.

It is a lasercut robotic hand that mounts to the underside of one's cast in the event they have broken their arm or wrist ot suffered some other forearm injury. Generally in these cases, the injured user can flex/move their fingers fully, however they can't hold any weight with them. With the ARD, a control glove worn over the cast can control the robotic hand, while the weight is distributed across the entire length of the cast, alleviating the pain.

The file srtucture of this repository is pretty simple, with folders for pictures, the wiring, the code, and the CAD files.
